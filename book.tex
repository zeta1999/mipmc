\section{Foreword}

The macro system is probably the most contradictory feature of C: it provides a way to extend
the host programming language with new syntactical constructs, thus forcing some ill-formed programs
fail to compile, through is an increasingly treacherous technology, being able to potentially
cause a numerous amount of bugs out of nothing.

This book was derived by my continuous experiments with the preprocessor: I have implemented some of
the concepts of functional programming, including algebraic data types (ADTs) with exhaustive
pattern matching, parametric polymorphism, higher-kinded types, and generalised ADTs, as well as from
the world of object orientation: classes, dynamic dispatch, and all the coherent stuff: type
introspection, type-safe error handling facilities and more.

So what I want to say: writing macros is an art. Macros, overall, can be considered as computer
languages on their own, with custom syntax, given by their signatures, and semantics, defined by their
bodies. In this book, I have accomplished my best concerning the development of macros, and I
do believe that it will advance a reader to a completely new dimension of metaprogramming, show how
much more beautiful macro interfaces can be, and develop the intuition in such a tricky topic.
